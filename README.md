## 🧠 How the AI Works

The app uses a feedback loop to continuously improve:

1. **Initial Prediction**: AI analyzes assignment description and difficulty
2. **User Completion**: You mark the assignment done and input actual time
3. **Learning**: AI compares prediction vs reality and adjusts its model
4. **Improvement**: Next predictions incorporate your specific patterns

This creates a **personalized AI** that understands YOUR working speed, not just generic averages.
